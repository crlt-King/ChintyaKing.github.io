                My team, consisting of myself, Desinta, and Charlene, participated in the UI/UX GEMASTIK competition, a prestigious event in the field of technology and innovation. In the competition, we developed an innovative app called Tiny Guard. This application is designed to help parents monitor their baby's sleep patterns, monitor the baby's sleeping position, and measure the temperature and humidity of the room. </p>
              <p>
                Tiny Guard comes as a baby monitoring solution to support optimal brain development and growth of babies. We believe that adequate and quality sleep is one of the important factors in baby's development, where the brain can develop well during sleep. In addition, the app is also designed to minimize the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), a condition that is of great concern to many parents.

                Although we didn't win the competition, our journey has been a very rewarding experience. During this process, we learned a lot about how to conceptualize a solution, create an attractive and user-friendly prototype, and write a scientific paper that supports our idea. We received a lot of feedback from the judges, which gave us new insights on how to write a better paper and improve our concept.
              </p>

                On top of that, this experience was also a lot of fun because we were able to collaborate with a great team. Each member of the team had their own role, from research to design, and everyone contributed their best to the project. Although the final result was not as expected, we feel proud of our work and grateful for all the lessons we have learned during this journey. This competition not only provided technical experience but also strengthened our teamwork and broadened our horizons in the UI/UX field.
